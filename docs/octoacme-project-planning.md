# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

<!-- Updated 2025-10-20: Expanded role references to include UX Designer, Release Manager, DevOps Engineer, Business Analyst, and Support Lead in planning activities (Issue #4) -->

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (include relevant roles: Product Manager, Project Manager, Developers, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Business Analyst, Release Manager, Support Lead)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (collaborate with Business Analyst for requirements clarity)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) - include input from DevOps Engineer on deployment readiness, UX Designer on design completion, and Support Lead on documentation requirements
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (coordinate with DevOps Engineer and Release Manager)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (align with Release Manager on release calendar)
