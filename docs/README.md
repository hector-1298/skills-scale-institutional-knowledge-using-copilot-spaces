# OctoAcme Project Management â€” Quick Start

## Purpose
Provide new teammates a concise overview of how OctoAcme runs projects, including roles, processes, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects delivering product features, services, or integrations.

## Key Principles
- **Customer-first**: prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: encourage feedback and learning

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: provide inputs and approvals

## Team Rhythm
- **Daily standups** (15 min): progress, blockers, dependencies
- **Weekly delivery sync**: progress updates, flagged risks
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: alignment and decision-making
- **Sprint demos/reviews**: showcase completed work
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: communicate status and milestones
- **Retrospectives**: capture learnings after sprints, releases, or milestones

## High-level Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: validate business need, define problem statement, align stakeholders, create project one-pager
2. **Planning**: break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, create release plan
3. **Execution**: build, test, review, iterate; track progress and manage blockers
4. **Release**: deploy to staging and production, run smoke tests, announce to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective**: capture learnings and convert to action items for continuous improvement
